        Installation
        ============
        
        - Launching cawind with firefox without overwrite your browser's preferences:
        
        First you need to create a folder for your firefox-cawind profile and put into it a copy of the file prefs.js  (in Mac this should be in ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/FOLDER.default).
        
        Now you need to edit your local cawind prefs.py, on Mac this should be in ~/Library/Application Support/windmill/prefs.py
        On PC this should be in C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\windmill\prefs.py
        
        MOZILLA_CREATE_NEW_PROFILE = False
        MOZILLA_DEFAULT_PROFILE = '~/place/you/put/your/profile'
        
        From now on, cawind will always launch that profile.
